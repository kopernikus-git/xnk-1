EncoCoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
[EncoCoin Core](http://encocoin.org/wallet) is the original EncoCoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of EncoCoin transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run EncoCoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/encocoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/encocoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run encocoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag EncoCoin-Qt to your applications folder, and then run EncoCoin-Qt.
